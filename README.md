# Logistic-Regression-from-scratch
Numpy implementation of Logistic Regression (w/o explicit ML libraries, such as Pytorch or Tensorflow)

## What is Logistic Regression
### Logistic Function
- also called as <b>Sigmoid Function</b></li>
- $y$ = $1 \over 1+e^{-x}$

- Output of logistic function is always in (0,1)  ==> Logistic function satisfies the condition of <b>Probability Density Function</b>

### Odds ( $\ne$ Probability)
- defined as 'probability that the event will occur divied by the probability that the event will not occur <br>
